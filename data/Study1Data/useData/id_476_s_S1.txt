"id_476"	39	1	3	"Once I learned that one box gave smaller values and variations, and the other gave larger values, I would start by trying to do a few from the large-value box.  I felt that the small-value box could be counted on to yield roughly 3 points per click (very roughly).  Thus, if I could get a couple high-value clicks on the other box, and get well ahead of the curve (need 4 points per click, on average, to get 100, obviously) then I could safely go back to the low-value box and limp my way home.  If I ever got too far behind the curve I had to take a chance on the high-value box.  Of course if I was unlucky with the high value box and got some big negative values, then I was in real trouble and could do nothing but stick with the high-value box and hope I made up the difference (but at that point it was usually too late)."	"Yes.  At first I was scared off the high-value box because of the large negatives that were possible.  However, I realized that it would be difficult to get 100 points from just the low-value box, and that I had to try to get some bigger positive numbers from the high-value box before going back to the relative safety of the low-value box.  (Or low-variation box, whatever you want to call it.  To me it was high- and low-value even if they averaged the same, though I'm not sure if they did or not.)"	2	2	1	2	"N/A"	1	"N/A"	1	2	2	2	25	1	5	4	3	1	NA	"I read the instructions"	4	2
