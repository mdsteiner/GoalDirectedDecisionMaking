"id_153"	36	1	2	"I tried to determine which box was which at first. After the first couple of games, it looked like the box with a lower variability gave more points on average. If I found that box first I tried to stick with it most of the time. It seems that if I found it right away, there was a good chance sticking with it would result in 100 points.

One or two clicks into the highly variable box seems like it would make or break the 100, so hitting a couple higher numbers right away and then switching to the other box made for easy points.
"	"I started out the first couple of games clicking a few at a time in each box and trying to get an idea for which one had a better payout on average. After those initial couple of games I started aiming for the low variability box if I could figure it out early enough, or if I got a couple lucky clicks in the highly variable one.

If it seemed like I wasn't going to make it, I switched to the high variability box and crossed my fingers."	2	2	1	2	NA	1	NA	1	2	2	2	10	2	5	2	3	1	NA	"I read the instructions"	5	2
