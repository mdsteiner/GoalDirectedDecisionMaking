"id_498"	25	1	3	"I would alternate between each box to initially determine which box was which. After that, I would play it by ear. If I got a few lucky big hits from the high variability box I would do it less compared to the low variability box. If I was getting hit by big negative values and losing clicks I would just click the high variability box with abandon in hopes of getting lucky. It didn't seem like getting 100 was possible with just the low variability box."	"My strategy started and ended basically the same, I would initially take a 50/50 approach to the boxes and adjust my risk analysis based on how close each click got me to 100. If I was at 80 with 10 more clicks I would only click the low variability box for example."	2	2	1	2	NA	1	NA	1	2	2	2	"25%"	2	5	3	1	1	1	NA	5	2
