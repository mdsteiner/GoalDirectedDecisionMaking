"id_539"	33	1	3	"One of the boxes seemed to have many more lower positive numbers.  It was possible to make it to 100 using only that box. If I found that box, I stuck with it.  If I hit a negative number early I knew to stay with the riskier box to hope for a larger positive number.  If I was too far away from 100 with only a few clicks left, I tried the riskier box (more large numbers) because there was no way I'd get to 100 with the box I was using."	"Very little.
