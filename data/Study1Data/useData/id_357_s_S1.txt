"id_357"	34	1	2	"Boxes that had high variability between positive and negative numbers seemed risky. Sure, you could land on a +20, but it seemed that the boxes that had smaller points values, like +5 did not have a high chance or drawing a zero, or worse, a negative number. My strategy was to use three clicks or so on each box, and see which one contained a high amount of variables and which one contained less variables. If, with one of those three clicks I landed on a big positive, great. But after I found which box had more small numbers and less large numbers and/or negatives, I spent the rest of my clicks on the one with the small chance of variation. Only if I had three clicks left and I was significantly below 100, would I then take a chance on the box with the high number of variables. My strategy was basically to determine which box had low variables, stick with it, and only risk a high variable click when all seemed lost."
