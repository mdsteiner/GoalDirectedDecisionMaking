"id_356"	29	1	4	"I tried to get a sense for which box had the most variation in the first few hits. Once I determined which one has the highest variation, I hit it until I had a substantial net positive and then used the box with the least variation to top of the rest of the score."	"At first I didn't have a sense of how much variation there was between the two boxes so I put a lot of clicks into getting a feel for that variance. After the first couple games I could usually tell which one had the higher variation within a few clicks because it was the one most likely to have a value in the double digits."	1	2	1	2	NA	1	NA	1	2	2	2	"25%"	2	4	4	1	1	1	NA	6	1
