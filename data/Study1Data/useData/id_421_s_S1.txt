"id_421"	28	1	5	"I tried to use a combination of both boxes. I noticed that one box would normally give positive values every time, but the values were low. The other box had much higher values, but seemed to give negative values more consistently. I also realized that I wasn't going to be able to reach the 100 points by using just a single box. So, I tried to hit some large enough values one one box, hoping to complete the rest of the points with the lower value box."	"Yes, at first I thought maybe it would be best to just stick to one box. But, that didn't work too well. One box gave fewer negative values, but the positive values weren't enough to reach 100 points. The other box did give high values, but also seemed to throw many more negative values also, So, sticking to that box wasn't going to lead to 100 points either. So, I changed my strategy to try and incorporate both boxes."	2	2	1	2	NA	1	NA	1	2	2	2	25	2	4	4	3	1	1	"I read the instructions"	6	2
