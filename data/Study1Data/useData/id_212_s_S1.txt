"id_212"	33	1	2	"In the first two rounds, I attempted to pull from only one deck to determine the average value of a pull from the given deck. Using this average, I determined that the conservative deck was likely to payout less than 4 points per pull, while the riskier deck could pay out significantly more per pull, or provide an equally negative value. Starting on the third round, I tried to locate the risky deck, and play until I felt I had enough points for the conservative deck to carry me over the 100 point threshold with my remaining number of draws."
